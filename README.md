# FastAPI & Next.js AI Chatbot

This project demonstrates how to integrate **FastAPI** with **Next.js** to build an AI-powered chatbot. The chatbot leverages FastAPI as the backend API service and Next.js for the frontend interface, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.

## Introduction
This project is designed to showcase the integration of FastAPI with Next.js to create a responsive and efficient AI chatbot. The chatbot can handle various user queries and provide relevant responses using natural language processing (NLP) models.

## Features
- **FastAPI Backend**: Handles API requests, processes user inputs, and communicates with the AI model.
- **Next.js Frontend**: Provides a modern, responsive user interface for interacting with the chatbot.
- **Real-time Communication**: Utilizes WebSockets for instant message delivery between the user and the chatbot.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to scale efficiently, making it suitable for production environments.

## Technologies Used
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building fast and user-friendly web applications.
- **WebSockets**: For real-time communication between the frontend and backend.
- **NLP Model**: (e.g., GPT-3 or similar) for generating intelligent responses to user queries.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and ensuring a consistent environment across different stages of development.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-nextjs-chatbot.git
cd fastapi-nextjs-chatbot
```

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2. Install Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the FastAPI server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2. Install Node.js dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Run the Next.js development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Docker Setup (Optional)
To run the project in Docker containers:
1. Build and start the services using Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

## Running the Project
Once the backend and frontend are running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the AI chatbot.

## API Endpoints
- **`POST /api/chat/`**: Send a message to the chatbot and receive a response.
- **`GET /api/health/`**: Health check endpoint to ensure the API is running.

## Frontend Integration
The frontend communicates with the FastAPI backend using the API endpoints. The `Chatbox.js` component handles the user input and displays the chatbot's responses in real-time.
